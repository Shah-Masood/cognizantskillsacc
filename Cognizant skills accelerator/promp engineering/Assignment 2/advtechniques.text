---------------------PART 1: REINFORCEMENT LEARNING WITH HUMAN FEEDBACK (RLHF)---------------------

(Correct Answer: B)

A) Gradient Descent
B) Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)
C) Adam Optimizer
D) K-Means Clustering
(Correct Answer: B)

Application Task:

Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is a method used to fine-tune large language models (LLMs) by incorporating human preferences into their training process. 
The first step involves generating outputs from a pre-trained language model, producing multiple possible responses to a given prompt. Next, in the human feedback stage, annotators review and rank these responses based on quality, 
relevance, and coherence. This labeled data helps the model understand which responses align best with human expectations.
After collecting human feedback, the next step is training a reward model. This model learns to predict a numerical reward score for different outputs based on the rankings provided by human evaluators. 
Finally, the LLM is fine-tuned using reinforcement learning, where it generates responses, receives reward signals from the trained reward model, and updates its parameters to optimize future outputs. This iterative process 
refines the model to produce more accurate, natural, and human-aligned responses.

Practical Applications of RLHF:
Healthcare – Enhancing medical chatbots to provide more accurate and empathetic responses when advising patients about symptoms and treatment options.
Customer Service – Improving virtual assistants by ranking responses based on user satisfaction, leading to more helpful and personalized support.
Creative Writing – Refining AI-generated storytelling by incorporating human preferences for tone, originality, and engagement, making AI-written content more compelling.

Reflection: Challenge in Scaling RLHF & Solution
One challenge in scaling RLHF is the subjectivity of human feedback, as different annotators may have varying opinions on what constitutes a good response, leading to inconsistencies in training data. 
A potential solution is to implement consensus-based ranking, where multiple reviewers evaluate each response and their feedback is aggregated using weighted scoring or majority voting. Additionally, using expert reviewers for specialized 
fields like medicine or law ensures that the AI aligns with industry-specific standards, reducing bias and improving the quality of reinforcement learning.


---------------------PART 2: ADVANCED PROMPT ENGINEERING---------------------


Application Task:

a) CoT Prompt:
"Solve the following math problem step by step. A store sells apples for $2 each and bananas for $3 each. If a customer buys 5 apples and 3 bananas, 
how much do they spend in total? Show your calculations at each step."

AI Response:
"The price of one apple is $2.
The customer buys 5 apples: 
5×2=10.
The price of one banana is $3.
The customer buys 3 bananas: 
3×3=9.
The total cost is 
10+9=19.
Final Answer: $19."

Evaluation: The step-by-step reasoning improves clarity by breaking down the problem into manageable parts, ensuring transparency and reducing the risk of errors.

b) Prompt:
"You are an AI customer service representative for Google. Your goal is to provide clear, polite, and professional responses while assisting customers with their inquiries."

Response Instructions:
If the user asks about a refund, provide the return policy and refund timeline.
If the user has a technical issue, offer troubleshooting steps or escalate to a live agent.
If the user asks for product recommendations, suggest options based on their preferences.

User Query: "I need a refund for a defective product."
Response: "I’m sorry to hear that! Our return policy allows refunds within 30 days of purchase. Please provide your order number so I can assist you further."

c) Domains:
Healthcare (Tone: Informative & Compassionate)
"You are a medical expert providing information to patients. Explain the symptoms, causes, and treatment options for Type 2 Diabetes in simple, non-technical language. Keep it concise (200-300 words) and ensure accuracy."

Legal (Tone: Formal & Precise)
"You are a legal advisor explaining the implications of breach-of-contract cases in business law. Provide a structured response that includes definitions, legal precedents, and possible remedies."

Creative Writing (Tone: Engaging & Imaginative)
"Write a short horror story (500 words) set in an abandoned hospital. Use suspenseful descriptions and an eerie atmosphere to build tension before revealing the supernatural element."

Reflection:

Advanced prompt engineering makes LLMs more adaptable by tailoring responses to specific industries, audiences, and tasks. In healthcare, clear and accurate prompts ensure that AI-generated medical advice remains informative yet accessible. 
In legal fields, precision is critical to avoid misinterpretation of laws or contracts. Meanwhile, 
in creative domains, prompts that encourage imagination and structured storytelling help LLMs generate compelling narratives.
By refining prompts with domain-specific terminology, role-based instructions, and structured formats, LLMs can adapt seamlessly to various professional settings. 
Additionally, dynamic inputs allow AI systems to adjust responses in real-time, making them more useful in customer service and decision-making applications. This adaptability ultimately enhances usability, 
accuracy, and trust in AI-driven solutions.


---------------------PART 3: ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS IN LLMS---------------------


Application Task:

Identifying Bias:
Biased Prompt:
"Why are electric cars better than gas-powered cars?"

Biased Output:
"Electric cars are superior in every way because they are environmentally friendly and cheaper to maintain."

Revised Prompt:
"Compare the advantages and disadvantages of electric and gas-powered cars in terms of cost, environmental impact, and performance."

Fine-tuned models in sensitive applications (Healthcare):
Potential Risks & Mitigation Strategies:
Misinformation in Medical Advice → Implement human oversight by ensuring AI-generated responses are reviewed by licensed professionals.
Data Privacy Violations → Enforce HIPAA compliance and anonymize patient data before AI processing.
Bias in Diagnosis or Treatment Recommendations → Use diverse and representative training data to reduce disparities in healthcare outcomes.

Crafting responsible prompts:
Prompt:
"Discuss the impacts of climate change from multiple perspectives, including scientific research, economic implications, and policy debates. 
Ensure a neutral and fact-based approach, avoiding speculation or politically charged language."

Reflection:

Ethical considerations are crucial for ensuring trust in AI systems, especially in high-stakes fields like healthcare, finance, and law. Biased outputs can reinforce stereotypes or spread misinformation, 
leading to unintended societal harm. Similarly, data privacy issues can arise if AI systems are not properly regulated, putting sensitive user information at risk.
By incorporating bias mitigation techniques, transparency in AI decisions, and human oversight, organizations can enhance accountability and foster public trust in AI applications. Additionally, using responsible 
prompting—such as ensuring neutrality in controversial topics—prevents AI from amplifying misinformation or one-sided narratives. As AI continues to integrate into daily life, prioritizing ethical prompt engineering is essential to 
maintaining fairness, reliability, and safety in AI-driven interactions.
