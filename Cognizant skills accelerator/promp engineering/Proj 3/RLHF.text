Task: Build a chatbot that answers health-related questions accurately while ensuring safety, clarity, and ethical responsibility.

Model Ourputs:

Prompt:
"What are the symptoms of diabetes?"

Output 1 (Overly Technical):
"Diabetes symptoms include polyuria, polydipsia, polyphagia, and unexplained weight loss. Hyperglycemia results from pancreatic β-cell dysfunction or insulin resistance."

Output 2 (Balanced & Clear):
"Diabetes symptoms may include frequent urination, increased thirst, sudden weight loss, fatigue, and blurred vision. If you suspect diabetes, consult a healthcare 
professional for proper diagnosis and management."

Output 3 (Oversimplified & Misleading):
"Diabetes makes you thirsty and tired. Just drink less sugar and you’ll be fine!"

Human feedback:

Evaluation Criteria:
Clarity – Can a non-medical person understand it?
Accuracy – Does it align with medical sources?
Ethical Considerations – Does it avoid misleading advice?
Ranking Based on Human Feedback:

Best: Output 2 (Balanced & Clear)
Output 1 (Too technical)
Worst: Output 3 (Misleading & Oversimplified)

Train a reward model:

The reward model assigns scores based on rankings.
Future responses get reinforced to match Output 2 style over time.
The chatbot learns to prioritize clear, accurate, and ethical responses.

Static Prompt:
"Answer the following health-related question clearly."

Dynamic prompt (role-playing):
"You are a trusted AI healthcare assistant. Your goal is to provide accurate and responsible health information.

Keep explanations clear and easy to understand.
Avoid providing diagnoses and encourage professional consultation for serious conditions.
Reference trusted medical sources (e.g., CDC, WHO).
Use neutral and non-alarming language.

What are the symptoms of diabetes?"

Improvements:
Ensures clarity
Encourages consultation with professionals
References authoritative sources

Prompt:
"How does insulin work in the body?"

AI Response:
"Insulin helps regulate blood sugar by allowing cells to absorb glucose."

CoT Prompt:
"Explain how insulin works step by step:

Describe the role of glucose in energy.
Explain how insulin facilitates glucose uptake.
Discuss what happens when insulin is insufficient (diabetes)."

AI Response (Improved Clarity):
"Glucose is the body’s main energy source—it comes from food.
Insulin, produced by the pancreas, allows cells to absorb glucose.
Without enough insulin, glucose stays in the blood, leading to diabetes symptoms."

Improvements:
Breaks down the topic for better understanding.
Makes responses more structured and informative.

Potential Bias Example:
"Diabetes mostly affects overweight individuals."

Correction:
"While excess weight is a risk factor, diabetes can affect people of all body types. Genetics, lifestyle, and other health conditions also play a role."

Data Provacy Strategies:
Anonymize sensitive data before training.
No storing user inputs—real-time response without saving history.
Explicit disclaimer:
"This AI does not provide medical diagnoses. Always consult a healthcare professional for medical concerns."

Summary Report (500 Words)
Challenges Faced and Solutions Implemented
Building an ethical healthcare chatbot required balancing accuracy, accessibility, and responsibility. One challenge was misinformation, as AI models sometimes generated overly simplified or misleading answers. We mitigated this by applying RLHF, where human feedback reinforced high-quality medical responses.

Another issue was bias in health-related responses. Initial outputs suggested incorrect assumptions about conditions like diabetes. By reviewing responses for bias and refining prompts to include disclaimers, we ensured neutral and responsible AI-generated content.

Impact of RLHF and Prompt Engineering
Applying RLHF significantly improved response quality by guiding the model towards human-validated best answers. This reduced misinformation and enhanced clarity, ensuring users receive accurate and ethical medical insights.

Prompt engineering played a key role in shaping AI behavior. A basic static prompt produced generic or vague responses, whereas a structured role-based prompt yielded clear, medically responsible answers. Additionally, Chain-of-Thought prompting helped break down complex health topics, making explanations easier to understand.

Ethical Safeguards & Impact on AI Responses
Bias Mitigation: We tested for implicit biases and refined prompts to ensure inclusive language.
Data Privacy: The chatbot operates without storing queries, ensuring confidentiality.
Medical Disclaimer: Every response includes "Consult a healthcare provider for personalized advice."
Overall, the combination of RLHF, prompt engineering, and ethical safeguards produced a trustworthy, responsible healthcare chatbot. Future improvements could include fine-tuning the model with expert-reviewed datasets and integrating real-time medical research updates.
