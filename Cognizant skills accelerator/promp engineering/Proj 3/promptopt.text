---------------------PART 2: DEBUGGING PROMPT FAILURES---------------------


Prompt:
"Explain quantum physics in an easy way and make it funny."

AI Response:
"Quantum physics is the study of tiny particles doing weird things. Imagine throwing a ball and it goes through two doors at once—crazy, right? That’s quantum superposition! And don’t even get me 
started on Schrödinger’s cat—poor thing is stuck between life and death. Quantum physics: where even scientists say, 'Just go with it!'"

What Went Wrong?:
Too vague – What aspect of quantum physics should be explained?
Lacks structure – No clear breakdown of key concepts.
Inconsistent humor – Humor is present but lacks depth.

Refined Prompt:
"You are a science educator explaining quantum physics to beginners. Break it down step by step:
Define quantum physics in one sentence.
Explain superposition with an everyday analogy.
Describe entanglement in simple terms.
Introduce Schrödinger’s cat paradox in a fun way.
End with a science joke about quantum physics."

AI Response to the Refined Prompt:
"Quantum physics is the study of how matter and energy behave at the smallest scales.
Superposition: Imagine you’re craving pizza and a burger at the same time, but you don’t decide until the waiter arrives—until then, you’re in a state of both wanting pizza and a burger (just like particles existing in multiple states).
Entanglement: Picture a magic twin pair—one in New York, the other in Tokyo. No matter how far apart they are, if one sneezes, the other says 'bless you' instantly! That’s quantum entanglement—particles staying connected across vast distances.
Schrödinger’s Cat: Imagine putting your cat in a box (hypothetically, don’t try this at home) with a device that may or may not release poison. Until you check, the cat is both alive and dead. Crazy, right?
And finally, a joke: Why did Heisenberg break up with his girlfriend? Because when he had her, he couldn’t measure her momentum, and when he measured her momentum, he lost her!"
