1. Task Definition

1.1 Chosen Use Case: Customer Support Chatbot
The objective of this project is to design and implement a customer support chatbot using Azure AI Studio's Prompt Flow. This chatbot will assist customers by:

Answering frequently asked questions.
Providing troubleshooting steps for common issues.
Directing users to relevant support resources.

1.2 Expected Outcomes
A chatbot capable of handling user queries with accurate, structured responses.
An interactive and responsive system optimized for clarity and relevance.
A scalable and monitored workflow that adapts based on user interactions.

2. Prompt Flow Design

2.1 Flow Components
Azure AI Studio’s Prompt Flow provides a visual way to design an LLM-powered chatbot. The key components include:

1️. Input Nodes (User Query Processing)
Captures user input from a chat interface.
Preprocesses text by removing unnecessary characters and normalizing formatting.

2️. Model Nodes (Processing with LLM)
Uses Azure OpenAI’s GPT-4 model to analyze the user query.
Contextual understanding: Ensures responses align with user intent.
Integrates external APIs to pull relevant information if needed (e.g., retrieving FAQs from a company knowledge base).

3️. Output Nodes (Delivering the Response)
Formats the model’s response into structured, easy-to-read text.
Sends the response to the chat interface or support dashboard.

3. Prototype Summary

3.1 Implementation Steps
Configured Azure AI Studio: Set up the workspace and enabled Prompt Flow tools.
Defined input formats: Established structured prompts for different types of customer queries.
Integrated GPT-4 model: Connected the chatbot to Azure OpenAI for response generation.
Tested and optimized prompts: Experimented with prompt engineering to ensure accurate and concise responses.
Deployed a prototype: Published a beta version of the chatbot for user testing.

3.2 Challenges Encountered
Inconsistent responses: Some queries generated vague or overly complex answers.
Latency issues: High response times were noted during heavy load testing.
Handling ambiguous queries: Some user questions required clarifications, which the model struggled to request.

4. Monitoring Insights

4.1 Key Metrics Tracked
Latency: Measured the average response time (target: <2 seconds).
Error Rate: Analyzed failed requests or incorrect responses.
User Engagement: Monitored feedback ratings on responses.
Query Categories: Identified the most frequently asked questions.

4.2 Findings from Monitoring
The model performed well (~85% accuracy) but struggled with highly technical queries.
Peak usage times resulted in slower response times (~3 seconds avg).
Users appreciated concise answers but requested more detailed follow-ups.

5. Future Improvements

5.1 Enhancing Prompt Design
Introduce dynamic prompt tuning based on user feedback.
Implement multi-turn conversation support to handle follow-up queries better.

5.2 Performance Optimization
Use Azure AI Caching to speed up responses for repeated queries.
Deploy a load-balanced API to handle peak traffic efficiently.

5.3 Expanding Functionality
Enable multilingual support for global customers.
Integrate with customer databases to provide personalized recommendations.

6. Conclusion
This project successfully implemented a customer support chatbot using Azure AI Studio’s Prompt Flow. The chatbot was tested, 
monitored, and optimized for accuracy and speed. Future iterations will focus on refining prompts, improving response times, 
and enabling more dynamic interactions.
